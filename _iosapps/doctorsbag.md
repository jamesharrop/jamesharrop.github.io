<h4>Update 2019: Not currently available on the App Store</h4>

This application, designed for use by medical professionals using iPhone or iPad, enables you to store a list of the medications which you keep in your doctor's bag, and helps you make sure they are all within their expiry date and ready to use.

A list of commonly used medications is provided to select from, or you can add custom medication names.

When a medication is approaching its expiry date, the app will alert you on your device (as long as you have allowed 'notifications' when requested).

You can then create an email to remind yourself to restock, or to ask a colleague to arrange a supply on your behalf.

Some drug doses are given for the most frequently used emergency drugs. Please note that you should however confirm up-to-date dosage information in a reference source such as the British National Formulary.
