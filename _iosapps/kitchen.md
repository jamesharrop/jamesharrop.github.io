This app is designed to enable you to keep a record of the spices and herbs which you store in your kitchen. 

When a product is approaching its expiry date, the app will alert you that month on your device (as long as you have allowed 'notifications' when requested).

You can then create a reminder to restock.

Please note that the app is not designed for products with short 'use by' dates such as dairy products.
