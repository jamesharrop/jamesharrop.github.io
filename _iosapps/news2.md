The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 is an aggregate scoring system to aid in identifying acutely ill patients.

This app is intended to assist trained clinicans who are already familiar with NEWS 2 with calculating the NEWS 2 score.

The score and risk levels are not a substitute for clinical judgement.

NEWS (2) is reproduced from: Royal College of Physicians. National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2: Standardising the assessment of acute-illness severity in the NHS. Updated report of a working party. London: RCP, 2017.

The full report and NEWS charts are available [here](https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/national-early-warning-score-news-2).
